_FlowNet_ aims at solving the following problems:

* Create data-driven reduced-physics models directly from data
* Train the models
* Assess model predictiveness
* Use the models to optimize and make decisions efficiently

## Contributing

Please check out our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute to FlowNet.

## Installation

_FlowNet_ is a Python package. Its Python dependencies are installed with the package,
but the [_OPM Flow_](https://opm-project.org/?page_id=19) simulator binary must be
installed separately.

If OPM Flow is not installed at `/usr/bin/flow`, set the `FLOW_PATH` environment
variable to the path of the Flow executable before running FlowNet.

### Install FlowNet

The recommended approach is to install FlowNet from PyPI:
```bash
python -m pip install flownet
```

To install the latest unreleased code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/flownet.git
cd flownet
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```
Omit the `-e` flag if you want a standard installation.

Python 3.11 is currently supported and tested. To install the test dependencies,
run `python -m pip install -e '.[tests]'` from the repository root.

> **Note:** When using the LSF queue, make sure the shell used by ERT activates the
> virtual environment. You may need to source it from your `.cshrc` or `.bashrc`.

### Running FlowNet

You can run _FlowNet_ as a single command line:
```
flownet ahm ./some_config.yaml ./some_output_folder
```
Run `flownet --help` to see all possible command line argument options.

### Running webviz to check results

Before running `webviz` for the first time, create and install a localhost HTTPS
certificate:
```bash
webviz certificate --auto-install --force
```
